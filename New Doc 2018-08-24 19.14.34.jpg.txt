(1) Glucose is oxidized step by step in the cells
during the process of respiration at the body
level.

(2) In anaerobic respiration, glucose is oxidized in
three steps.

(3) Gluconeogenesis is also called Embden-
Meyerhof-Parnas pathway.

(4) Molecules of pyruvic acid formed in this
glycolysis are converted into molecules of lactic
acid.

(5) Excess of ATP molecules obtained from
proteins are not stored in the body.

(6) Proteins of plant origin are called ‘first class’
proteins.
